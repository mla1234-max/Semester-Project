# Inventory System
This is my semester project of my inventory system.

### This project consists of an inventory management system that provides info for and tracks items in an inventory, similar to what you would do in a video game.

### Functions:
### ListInfo: Provides the information on the current inventory including item name, weight, price, and quantity.
### AddItem: Allows you to give necessary info for a new item and adds that item to the inventory.
### RemoveItem: Allows to take a selected item away and update to the inventory.
### GiveWeight: Asks you to identify an item's weight in pounds.
### GivePrice: Asks you to identify an item's price in dollars.
### GiveAmount: Asks you to identify the number of the item you wish to add.
